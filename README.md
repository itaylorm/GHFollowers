# GHFollowers
Proof of concept project for working with users and their followers on GitHub. This is a work in progress that demonstrated how to build a coded UI without a Storyboard.

## Note: 
This is my version of the code from SAllen0400's course. See the Original Course titled "iOS Dev Job Interview Practice" which can be found here https://seanallen.teachable.com/courses

# Third Party Libraries
1. Open Terminal
2. Install CocoaPods - Sudo gem install cocoapods
3. Clone Project to your machine
4. Open terminal in the directory where you copied the project (The one that has the .xcodeproj in it)
5. Run 'Pod init' If you don't have Pods installed
6. Run 'Pod install' to copy down the different dependencies
7. Open project with the Garment.xcworkspace NOT the Garment.xcodeproj

# Swift Lint
The only third party project is SwiftLint for syntax checking. You can learn more about this tool at https://academy.realm.io/posts/slug-jp-simard-swiftlint/

# Current Status of the Project
The basic project is completed with the ability to view a user's followers and details about them. This includes the ability to favorite certain users for following them and seeing their followers
