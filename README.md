# GHFollowers
Proof of concept project for working with users and their followers on GitHub. This is a work in progress that demonstrated how to build a coded UI without a Storyboard.

## Note: 
This is my version of the code from SAllen0400's course. See the Original Course titled "iOS Dev Job Interview Practice" which can be found here https://seanallen.teachable.com/courses

# Current Status of the Project
The basic project is completed with the ability to view a user's followers and details about them
